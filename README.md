<h1> Project Outline: </h1>
<p>
	StreetSniper is a street guessing game akin to GeoGuessr, though more targeted to the loyal residents of major metropolitan regions. <br>
	Users are placed in a random street in their city, and using a perpetually varying point system, are rewarded with a proportional score.
</p>


<h1> Data & image parsing: </h1>

<p>
	Images must not contain the street names (for obvious reasons), and via OpenCV and python libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, one can blur all instances <br>
	of the respective street name. Most data parsing is done in python, whilst the actual program is written in C++ for performance reasons.
</p>
